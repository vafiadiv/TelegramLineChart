# .gitignore file for Xcode / OS X Source projects
#
# NB: if you are storing "built" products, this WILL NOT WORK,
#   and you should use a different .gitignore (or none at all)
# This file is for SOURCE projects, where there are many extra
#   files that we want to exclude
#
# For updates, see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/49478/git-ignore-file-for-xcode-projects

# Xcode private settings (window sizes, bookmarks, breakpoints, custom executables, smart groups)
#
# This is complicated:
#
# SOMETIMES you need to put this file in version control.
# Apple designed it poorly - if you use "custom executables", they are
#  saved in this file.
# 99% of projects do NOT use those, so they do NOT want to version control this file.
#  ..but if you're in the 1%, comment out the line "*.pbxuser"

*.pbxuser
*.mode1v3
*.mode2v3
*.perspectivev3
#    NB: also, whitelist the default ones, some projects need to use these
!default.pbxuser
!default.mode1v3
!default.mode2v3
