# TelegramLineChart

An app for 2019 Telegram iOS Development contest (https://t.me/contest/6).

The goal of the app is to parse a bundled JSON file and to display a set of line charts based on the data from the file.

No 3rd party libraries used, all drawing is done via Quartz2D and CoreAnimation frameworks.
